			<h2>Password Manager</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/jadendick/Password_Manager" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>This project is a simple application to interact with a text file of login information. To protect the file from being read by anyone, users 
				choose a password that is used to encrypt the file with. This way the file can't be read unless you know the correct password.</p>
			<p>I decided to write this project so that I could refresh my basic C++ skills after a semester of not using them. I was also able to incorporate data 
				structures through a binary tree storage system.</p>

			<h2>Personal Website</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/jadendick/Personal_Website" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
			<p>This website serves as an easy place to showcase for all my programming projects. The site itself is a project as I have used it to 
				learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

			<h2>MIPS Connect 4</h2>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ixAhl9xCA4&feature=emb_title" target="_blank">Video showcasing game</a>
			<p>This was a semester long project for my computer architecture class that was worked on by myself and two others. I wrote the majority of the MIPS
				assembly code to get the game working. The project taught me a lot about solving problems in an efficient manner as choosing a bad solution would 
				lead to an excess amount of code.</p>
			<p>The biggest challenge was choosing how to represent the position of pieces in memory. The solution I came up with was to store the game board as
				one long string. This decision ended up making it very simple to traverse the board for other functions of the game.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I enjoy learning about new technologies and discovering interesting solutions to problems. 
			A passion for tinkering and creating my own projects makes up a large portion for why I chose computer science. 
			Outside of programming, I try to spend my spare time being active by playing basketball and going for bike rides.</p>
